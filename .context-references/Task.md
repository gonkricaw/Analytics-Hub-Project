# Task List: Indonet Analytics Hub Development

## Introduction

This document outlines the detailed tasks required for the development of the "Indonet Analytics Hub." It is structured by development phases and aims to provide a clear roadmap for implementation. Adherence to the previously established Development Plan and Logical System Design is crucial.

**IMPORTANT: Before starting any new major feature or phase, developers MUST perform the following "Pre-Implementation Check."**

---

## ðŸŒŸ General Pre-Implementation Check (Crucial Note) ðŸŒŸ

**Before proceeding with tasks in each section, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed and understand:**

1.  **The Overall Development Plan:** Understand the goals and scope of the current phase and how it fits into the larger project.
2.  **The Logical System Design:** Understand the architecture, data flow, and how the components you are building interact with the rest of the system.
3.  **Configuration File Consistency & Management:**
    * Verify that your local setup aligns with the project's standards.
    * Be prepared to update these files as needed during implementation, ensuring consistency with the Vuexy template and project guidelines:
        * `.editorconfig`
        * `.eslintrc.cjs`
        * `.stylelintrc.json`
        * `auto-imports.d.ts`
        * `components.d.ts`
        * `composer.json`
        * `jsconfig.json`
        * `package.json`
        * `themeConfig.js`
        * `typed-router.d.ts`
        * `vite.config.js`
    * Document any significant changes or additions to these configurations.
4.  **Existing Code & Vuexy Template Structure:** Leverage existing components and patterns from the Vuexy template wherever possible to maintain consistency and accelerate development.

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Initial Configuration âœ… **COMPLETED**

* **Objective:** Establish the foundational development environment and basic application shell.
* **Pre-Implementation Check:** Review general guidelines above.

* **Tasks:**
    * [âœ…] **Environment Setup:**
        * [âœ…] Set up local development environment (PHP, Node.js, Composer, PostgreSQL).

        * [âœ…] Configure Laravel `.env` file:
            * `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`
            * Database connection (PostgreSQL): `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
            * Mail driver settings (`MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, etc.)
            * Other necessary environment variables.
        * [âœ…] Run initial `composer install` and `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
        * [âœ…] Run initial database migrations: `php artisan migrate`.
        * [âœ…] Generate Laravel application key: `php artisan key:generate`.
    * [âœ…] **Basic Application Configuration:**
        * [âœ…] Configure Laravel `config/app.php` (timezone, locale).
        * [âœ…] **Global Theme:** Implement "Dark Mode Only" as the exclusive theme.
            * [âœ…] Ensure Vuexy `themeConfig.js` (or `.ts`) is set for dark mode by default and options for light mode are disabled/removed if applicable.
            * [âœ…] Verify all base layouts and components render correctly in dark mode.
        * [âœ…] **Navigation Structure:**
            * [âœ…] Configure main navigation to use a **Sticky Navbar or Horizontal Navbar**.
            * [âœ…] Ensure no sidebar is used for menu navigation after login.
            * [âœ…] The Navbar should be prepared to hold: App Logo, Menu List, User Avatar/Profile Access, Notification Bell.
        * [âœ…] **Iconography:**
            * [âœ…] Integrate and test **Font Awesome icons**. Ensure they can be easily used in both Blade (if any) and Vue components.
        * [âœ…] **Initial UI Shell & Layouts:**
            * [âœ…] Define main Vue layouts (e.g., `LayoutAuthenticated.vue`, `LayoutGuest.vue`).

            * [âœ…] Set up basic Vue Router configuration (`router/index.js` or `.ts`):
                * [âœ…] Define initial routes (e.g., `/login`, `/dashboard` or `/home`).
                * [âœ…] Implement route guards for authentication (redirect to login if not authenticated).
        * [âœ…] **Version Control:**
            * [âœ…] Initialize Git repository.
            * [âœ…] Create initial commit with the base project setup.

                * Validate token, email, and new password (policy).
                * Update user's password. Delete/invalidate token.
        * **Frontend:**
            * [âœ…] "Forgot Password?" link on Login page navigates to a "Request Password Reset" page/modal. Form for email.
            * [âœ…] API call to request password reset. Display confirmation message.

            * [âœ…] On timeout, call logout API automatically or prompt user to stay logged in.
            * [âœ…] If user closes browser/tab, session should ideally be cleared on server based on session lifetime or require re-login.
    * [âœ…] **Terms & Conditions (T&C) Management & Acceptance:**
        * **Backend:**
            * [âœ…] Create `terms_and_conditions` table (id, content, version, created_at, updated_at).

    * [âœ…] **Admin IP Unblocking (Placeholder for full Admin Panel):**
        * **Backend:**
            * [âœ…] API endpoint for admin to list blocked IPs (e.g., GET `/api/admin/blocked-ips`).
            * [âœ…] API endpoint for admin to unblock an IP (e.g., DELETE `/api/admin/blocked-ips/{ip_address}`).
        * **Frontend (Admin Panel Section):**
            * [âœ…] UI to display list of blocked IPs with an "Unblock" button.

            * [âœ…] Conditionally render UI elements (buttons, menu items) based on user permissions fetched from backend or determined client-side after login (if permissions are part of user payload).
            * [âœ…] Protect Vue routes using navigation guards that check user roles/permissions.
            * [âœ…] Display access rights/roles as **badges** in user listings or profile views if required.

- **URL Pattern Fixes:** Corrected test API endpoints to match actual route definitions
- **Controller Logic Enhancement:** Added comprehensive validation and authorization checks for role assignment

**Validation Results:** 100% completion rate with production-ready implementation (22/22 UserRoleController tests passing).
