# Task List: Indonet Analytics Hub Development

## Introduction

This document outlines the detailed tasks required for the development of the "Indonet Analytics Hub." It is structured by development phases and aims to provide a clear roadmap for implementation. Adherence to the previously established Development Plan and Logical System Design is crucial.

**IMPORTANT: Before starting any new major feature or phase, developers MUST perform the following "Pre-Implementation Check."**

---

## ðŸŒŸ General Pre-Implementation Check (Crucial Note) ðŸŒŸ

**Before proceeding with tasks in each section, ensure you have thoroughly reviewed and understand:**

1.  **The Overall Development Plan:** Understand the goals and scope of the current phase and how it fits into the larger project.
2.  **The Logical System Design:** Understand the architecture, data flow, and how the components you are building interact with the rest of the system.
3.  **Configuration File Consistency & Management:**
    * Verify that your local setup aligns with the project's standards.
    * Be prepared to update these files as needed during implementation, ensuring consistency with the Vuexy template and project guidelines:
        * `.editorconfig`
        * `.eslintrc.cjs`
        * `.stylelintrc.json`
        * `auto-imports.d.ts`
        * `components.d.ts`
        * `composer.json`
        * `jsconfig.json`
        * `package.json`
        * `themeConfig.js`
        * `typed-router.d.ts`
        * `vite.config.js`
    * Document any significant changes or additions to these configurations.
4.  **Existing Code & Vuexy Template Structure:** Leverage existing components and patterns from the Vuexy template wherever possible to maintain consistency and accelerate development.

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Initial Configuration

* **Objective:** Establish the foundational development environment and basic application shell.
* **Pre-Implementation Check:** Review general guidelines above.

* **Tasks:**
    * [ ] **Environment Setup:**
        * [ ] Set up local development environment (PHP, Node.js, Composer, PostgreSQL).
        * [ ] Clone/Install Vuexy - Laravel + Vuejs Admin Dashboard Template.
        * [ ] Configure Laravel `.env` file:
            * `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`
            * Database connection (PostgreSQL): `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
            * Mail driver settings (`MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, etc.)
            * Other necessary environment variables.
        * [ ] Run initial `composer install` and `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
        * [ ] Run initial database migrations: `php artisan migrate`.
        * [ ] Generate Laravel application key: `php artisan key:generate`.
    * [ ] **Basic Application Configuration:**
        * [ ] Configure Laravel `config/app.php` (timezone, locale).
        * [ ] **Global Theme:** Implement "Dark Mode Only" as the exclusive theme.
            * [ ] Ensure Vuexy `themeConfig.js` (or `.ts`) is set for dark mode by default and options for light mode are disabled/removed if applicable.
            * [ ] Verify all base layouts and components render correctly in dark mode.
        * [ ] **Navigation Structure:**
            * [ ] Configure main navigation to use a **Sticky Navbar or Horizontal Navbar**.
            * [ ] Ensure no sidebar is used for menu navigation after login.
            * [ ] The Navbar should be prepared to hold: App Logo, Menu List, User Avatar/Profile Access, Notification Bell.
        * [ ] **Iconography:**
            * [ ] Integrate and test **Font Awesome icons**. Ensure they can be easily used in both Blade (if any) and Vue components.
        * [ ] **Initial UI Shell & Layouts:**
            * [ ] Define main Vue layouts (e.g., `LayoutAuthenticated.vue`, `LayoutGuest.vue`).
            * [ ] Implement global **loading process animations** (e.g., a spinner or progress bar for page transitions and initial data loads).
            * [ ] Set up basic Vue Router configuration (`router/index.js` or `.ts`):
                * [ ] Define initial routes (e.g., `/login`, `/dashboard` or `/home`).
                * [ ] Implement route guards for authentication (redirect to login if not authenticated).
        * [ ] **Version Control:**
            * [ ] Initialize Git repository.
            * [ ] Create initial commit with the base project setup.
            * [ ] Define branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
    * [ ] **Testing:**
        * [ ] Ensure basic Laravel and Vue application can run without errors.
        * [ ] Verify PostgreSQL connection.

            * [ ] Ensure no public registration page/link exists. Application opens directly to login.
    * [ ] **Initial Login & Password Change:**
        * **Backend:**
            * [ ] Create API endpoint for changing password (e.g., POST `/api/user/change-password`).
            * [ ] Middleware to check if `temporary_password_used` is false for authenticated user on certain routes.
            * [ ] Controller logic to validate current password (if applicable, or just new password for initial change), new password (policy: min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number), and confirmation.
            * [ ] Update user's password (hashed) and set `temporary_password_used` to true.
        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] Create Vue Change Password page component.

            * [ ] Form for new password and password confirmation. Display password policy requirements.
            * [ ] API call to change password.
            * [ ] On success, redirect to Home/Welcome page and show success message.
    * [ ] **User Profile Management (Post-Login):**
        * **Backend:**
            * [ ] API endpoint for user to update their profile (e.g., POST `/api/user/profile`).
            * [ ] Allow updating password (re-use change password logic/validation) and profile photo.
            * [ ] Prevent updating name and email via this endpoint.
            * [ ] Handle profile photo upload (store file, update `profile_photo_path` in DB).
        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] Create "Edit Profile" page/modal.
            * [ ] Form fields for current password (if changing password), new password, password confirmation.

                * Validate email exists. Generate a unique, one-time use token (store hashed token with expiry in `password_resets` table).
                * Send password reset email (see Email Management) with a link containing the token.
            * [ ] API endpoint to reset password (e.g., POST `/api/password/reset`). Input: email, token, new password, password confirmation.
                * Validate token, email, and new password (policy).
                * Update user's password. Delete/invalidate token.
        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] "Forgot Password?" link on Login page navigates to a "Request Password Reset" page/modal. Form for email.
            * [ ] API call to request password reset. Display confirmation message.
            * [ ] Create "Reset Password" page (accessed via email link). Form for email, new password, password confirmation. Token will be part of the URL.
            * [ ] API call to reset password. On success, redirect to Login page with success message.
    * [ ] **Logout Process:**

        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] Logout button in Navbar/Profile dropdown.
            * [ ] Display **popup confirmation** ("Are you sure you want to logout?") before proceeding.
            * [ ] On confirmation, call logout API.
            * [ ] Clear client-side user state and redirect to Login page.
    * [ ] **Automatic Logout (Inactivity):**
        * **Backend:**
            * [ ] Middleware to update `last_active_at` on authenticated API requests.
        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] Implement client-side timer (e.g., 15 minutes).
            * [ ] On timeout, call logout API automatically or prompt user to stay logged in.
            * [ ] If user closes browser/tab, session should ideally be cleared on server based on session lifetime or require re-login.
    * [ ] **Terms & Conditions (T&C) Management & Acceptance:**
        * **Backend:**
            * [ ] Create `terms_and_conditions` table (id, content, version, created_at, updated_at).
            * [ ] API endpoint for admin to update T&C content (e.g., PUT `/api/admin/terms-conditions`).
            * [ ] API endpoint to fetch current T&C (e.g., GET `/api/terms-conditions`).
            * [ ] (Consider logging T&C acceptance: `user_tnc_acceptance` table - user_id, tnc_version, accepted_at).
        * **Frontend:**
            * [ ] After successful login & redirection to Home/Welcome (and after initial password change if applicable), display a **modal popup** with T&C content fetched from API.
            * [ ] "Accept" button: Closes modal, user proceeds. (Log acceptance if implemented).
            * [ ] "Decline" button: Calls logout API, redirects to Login page.
            * [ ] This modal must appear on every successful login session until accepted for that session or based on a "don't show again for this session" cookie after first acceptance.
    * [ ] **Admin IP Unblocking (Placeholder for full Admin Panel):**
        * **Backend:**
            * [ ] API endpoint for admin to list blocked IPs (e.g., GET `/api/admin/blocked-ips`).
            * [ ] API endpoint for admin to unblock an IP (e.g., DELETE `/api/admin/blocked-ips/{ip_address}`).
        * **Frontend (Admin Panel Section):**
            * [ ] UI to display list of blocked IPs with an "Unblock" button.
    * [ ] **Testing:**
        * [ ] Unit tests for all new backend logic (User model, Auth controllers, services).
        * [ ] Feature tests for all API endpoints.
        * [ ] Frontend unit/component tests for Login, Change Password, Profile, T&C modal.
        * [ ] End-to-end tests for all user flows.

## Phase 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

* **Objective:** Implement a comprehensive RBAC system to control user access to application features and data.
* **Pre-Implementation Check:** Review general guidelines, overall plan, logical system, and config files.

* **Tasks:**
    * [ ] **Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
        * [ ] Create `roles` table (id, name, display_name, description). Name should be unique (e.g., 'admin', 'manager', 'sales_user').
        * [ ] Create `permissions` table (id, name, display_name, description). Name should be unique (e.g., 'create-users', 'edit-content', 'view-reports').
        * [ ] Create `role_user` pivot table (user_id, role_id).
        * [ ] Create `permission_role` pivot table (permission_id, role_id).
        * [ ] Run migrations.
    * [ ] **Backend (Laravel):**
        * [ ] Create Eloquent models: `Role`, `Permission`.
        * [ ] Define relationships in models (`User` hasMany `Role`, `Role` hasMany `Permission`, etc.).
        * [ ] **Permissions Management (Admin API Endpoints):**
            * [ ] GET `/api/admin/permissions` (List all permissions).
            * [ ] POST `/api/admin/permissions` (Create new permission: name, display_name, description).
            * [ ] PUT `/api/admin/permissions/{id}` (Update permission).
            * [ ] DELETE `/api/admin/permissions/{id}` (Delete permission).
        * [ ] **Roles Management (Admin API Endpoints):**
            * [ ] GET `/api/admin/roles` (List all roles).
            * [ ] POST `/api/admin/roles` (Create new role: name, display_name, description).
            * [ ] PUT `/api/admin/roles/{id}` (Update role).
            * [ ] DELETE `/api/admin/roles/{id}` (Delete role).
            * [ ] POST `/api/admin/roles/{id}/permissions` (Assign/sync permissions to a role).
        * [ ] **User Role Assignment (Admin API Endpoints - extend User Management):**
            * [ ] GET `/api/admin/users/{id}/roles` (Get roles for a user).
            * [ ] PUT `/api/admin/users/{id}/roles` (Assign/sync roles to a user).
        * [ ] **Authorization Logic:**
            * [ ] Implement Laravel Gates and/or Policies for all relevant models and actions.
            * [ ] Examples: `UserPolicy` (can view, create, update, delete users), `ContentPolicy`, `MenuPolicy`.
            * [ ] Use these policies in controllers to authorize actions.
            * [ ] Create middleware for route-level role/permission checks if needed.
        * [ ] **Seeders:**
            * [ ] Create `RolesSeeder` (e.g., 'Admin', 'Manager', 'User').
            * [ ] Create `PermissionsSeeder` for all core permissions.
            * [ ] Seed default role-permission assignments (e.g., Admin gets all permissions).
            * [ ] Assign 'Admin' role to the initial admin user.
    * [ ] **Frontend (Vue.js - Admin Panel Section):**
        * [ ] Create UI sections for managing Permissions:
            * List permissions with options to Create, Edit, Delete.
            * Forms for creating/editing permissions.
        * [ ] Create UI sections for managing Roles:
            * List roles with options to Create, Edit, Delete.
            * Forms for creating/editing roles.
            * Interface to assign permissions to roles (e.g., checklist of permissions).
        * [ ] Extend User Management UI (Admin Panel):
            * Interface to assign roles to users (e.g., checklist or multi-select).
        * [ ] **UI Behavior based on RBAC:**
            * Conditionally render UI elements (buttons, menu items) based on user permissions fetched from backend or determined client-side after login (if permissions are part of user payload).
            * Protect Vue routes using navigation guards that check user roles/permissions.
            * Display access rights/roles as **badges** in user listings or profile views if required.
    * [ ] **Testing:**
        * [ ] Unit tests for Role, Permission models and relationships.
        * [ ] Feature tests for all RBAC API endpoints.
        * [ ] Test authorization logic (Gates/Policies) thoroughly.
        * [ ] Frontend tests for admin panel RBAC UIs.
        * [ ] End-to-end tests: Log in as different roles and verify access restrictions.

## Phase 3: Menu & Content Management

* **Objective:** Enable dynamic management of application navigation and content by authorized users.
* **Pre-Implementation Check:** Review general guidelines, overall plan, logical system, and config files.

* **Tasks:**
    * [ ] **Menu Management:**
        * **Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
            * [ ] Create `menus` table (id, parent_id nullable, name, type ['list_menu', 'content_menu'], icon (Font Awesome class), route_or_url, content_id nullable, order, role_permissions_required (JSON or related table)).
            * [ ] Run migrations.
        * **Backend (Laravel):**
            * [ ] Create `Menu` Eloquent model with self-referencing relationship for parent/child.
            * [ ] API endpoints for Menu Management (CRUD by admin/privileged users):
                * GET `/api/menus` (Fetch menus accessible by the current user, respecting RBAC, for frontend rendering).
                * GET `/api/admin/menus` (Fetch all menus for management).
                * POST `/api/admin/menus` (Create menu item).
                * PUT `/api/admin/menus/{id}` (Update menu item).
                * DELETE `/api/admin/menus/{id}` (Delete menu item).
                * (Optional) Endpoint to reorder menus.
            * [ ] Logic to handle menu hierarchy (parent > child > content, parent > content, multi-level dropdowns).
            * [ ] Ensure menu API respects RBAC for managing and accessing menus.
        * **Frontend (Vue.js):**
            * [ ] **Menu Rendering:**
                * Fetch accessible menus from `/api/menus` after login.
                * Dynamically render the main navigation (Navbar/Horizontal Navbar) based on fetched menu data, including Font Awesome icons and hierarchical structures.
            * [ ] **Menu Management UI (Admin Panel / Privileged User Section):**
                * Interface to list, create, edit, delete menu items.
                * Form fields for: name, parent menu (dropdown), type (list/content), icon (Font Awesome picker/input), route/URL or content link, order, required roles/permissions.
    * [ ] **Content Management:**
        * **Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
            * [ ] Create `contents` table (id, title, slug (unique), type ['custom', 'embed_url'], custom_content (TEXT type for HTML), embed_url_original (TEXT), embed_url_uuid (UUID, unique), created_by_user_id, updated_by_user_id).
            * [ ] Run migrations.
        * **Backend (Laravel):**
            * [ ] Create `Content` Eloquent model.
            * [ ] API endpoints for Content Management (CRUD by users with rights):
                * GET `/api/content` (List accessible content - respecting RBAC).
                * GET `/api/content/{slug_or_uuid}` (Fetch specific content - respecting RBAC).
                * POST `/api/content` (Create new content).
                * PUT `/api/content/{id}` (Update content).
                * DELETE `/api/content/{id}` (Delete content).
            * [ ] Logic for `custom` content type: Store HTML from text editor.
            * [ ] Logic for `embed_url` content type:
                * Generate UUIDv4 for `embed_url_uuid` on creation.
                * Implement middleware/logic for **encrypting/decrypting `embed_url_original`** (ensure this isn't directly exposed in API responses if sensitive, only use UUID for client-side linking to an internal route).
                * Create a dedicated route like `/app/embed/{uuid}` that loads the embed. This route must be protected by authentication. Accessing it without login redirects to the main login page.
            * [ ] Implement ContentPolicy to control access based on user permissions.
        * **Frontend (Vue.js):**
            * [ ] **Content Display Pages/Components:**
                * Component to render `custom` content (using `v-html` carefully, or a sanitizer if content is from less trusted users). Apply narrow margin styling.
                * Component to render `embed_url` content (iframe filling full width of content area). Use the `/app/embed/{uuid}` route.
            * [ ] **Content Management UI (Accessible by Privileged Users):**
                * Interface to list, create, edit, delete content.
                * Form for content creation/editing:

* **Tasks:**
    * [ ] **In-App Notification System:**
        * **Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
            * [ ] Create `notifications` table (id, title, content (TEXT for HTML), created_by_user_id, created_at).
            * [ ] Create `user_notifications` pivot table (user_id, notification_id, read_at nullable, created_at).

            * [ ] Logic in Laravel Mailables to:
                * Check for a user-defined template from the database based on a specific key (e.g., 'user_invitation').
                * If not found, use a hard-coded system default template.
                * Parse template `body` and `subject` for dynamic placeholders (e.g., `{{userName}}`, `{{resetLink}}`) and replace them with actual data before sending.
        * **Frontend (Vue.js - Admin Panel / Privileged User Section):**
            * [ ] Interface to list, create, edit, delete email templates.
            * [ ] Form for template editing: name, subject, body (using a rich text editor or HTML editor that supports dynamic placeholders, static text, images, YouTube, docs, buttons). Explain available placeholders.
