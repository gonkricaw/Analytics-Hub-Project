### ISSUE SUMMARY
The application was failing to load due to references to a non-existent asset file `main-C-93R6vv.js`, causing the browser to receive 404 errors and preventing the Vue.js application from initializing.

### ROOT CAUSE
- Hardcoded asset file name in `routes/web.php` was pointing to an old Vite-generated file
- After a new build, Vite generated a new hashed filename `main-D4DSGRtK.js`
- The old file `main-C-93R6vv.js` no longer existed, causing 404 errors

### RESOLUTION ACTIONS TAKEN

#### 1. Updated Asset References
- ✅ Fixed `routes/web.php` - Updated hardcoded asset reference from `main-C-93R6vv.js` to `main-D4DSGRtK.js`
- ✅ Updated `public/api-diagnostics.php` - Corrected diagnostic file reference
- ✅ Updated `check-manifest.php` - Fixed test script reference

#### 2. Verified Asset Availability
- ✅ Confirmed current asset file `main-D4DSGRtK.js` exists and is accessible
- ✅ Confirmed CSS asset file `main-Czk1McQF.css` exists and is accessible
- ✅ Verified manifest.json contains correct asset mappings

#### 3. Tested Application Loading
- ✅ Main application page returns HTTP 200
- ✅ Current asset files are accessible
- ✅ Old asset file references removed from HTML output
- ✅ Application loads without 404 errors

### CURRENT STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED

All tests pass successfully:
- Main page accessible (HTTP 200)
- Current asset file (main-D4DSGRtK.js) found in HTML
- Old asset file not referenced in HTML  
- Current asset file accessible (HTTP 200)
- CSS asset file accessible (HTTP 200)

### FILES MODIFIED
1. `routes/web.php` - Updated asset redirect route (already corrected)
2. `public/api-diagnostics.php` - Updated diagnostic asset reference
3. `check-manifest.php` - Updated test script asset reference

### ENHANCED SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. Dynamic Asset Loading
Implemented a robust solution using a dedicated `AssetManager` helper class:

```php
Route::get('/js/app.js', function() {
    try {
        $jsPath = AssetManager::getMainJs();
        
        if ($jsPath) {
            return Redirect::to($jsPath);
        }
        
        Log::warning('Main JS asset not found in manifest');
        return abort(404, 'Main JS asset not found in manifest');
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        Log::error('JS asset loading error: ' . $e->getMessage());
        return abort(500, 'Asset loading failed');
    }
});
```

#### 2. Asset Validation Tool
Created `validate-assets.php` script that:
- Reads the manifest file
- Verifies each asset exists on disk
- Reports missing assets
- Integrated with the build process via npm scripts

#### 3. 404 Error Monitoring
Implemented `monitor-asset-404s.php` script that:
- Analyzes log files for 404 errors related to assets
- Reports frequency and context of errors
- Provides recommendations for fixing issues
- Supports email alerting for critical errors

#### 4. Automation & Documentation
- Added npm scripts for asset validation: `npm run check:assets` and `npm run build:check`
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/ASSET-MANAGEMENT.md`
- Set up automated post-build checks with `post-build-check.bat`

### CONCLUSION
The critical asset loading issue has been completely resolved. The application is now loading properly with all assets accessible. The implemented fix ensures compatibility with the current Vite build output while maintaining proper error handling for missing assets.
